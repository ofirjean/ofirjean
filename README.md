I'm a DevOps learner and builder who loves combining code, automation, and creativity. My journey started with Docker and Flask, and grew into real-world projects using Kubernetes and cloud-native design. I enjoy working on hands-on solutions — especially ones that connect backend logic with AI-driven outcomes. Outside of coding, you'll probably find me lifting weights at the gym or exploring new ways to blend fitness and artificial intelligence into cool personal tools. I believe learning by building is the most powerful approach, and my projects reflect that mindset. Let's connect and create something awesome!

🌍  I'm based in Israel
